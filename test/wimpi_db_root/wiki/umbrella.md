The At district of Tenochtitlan was reported to have used an umbrella made from
feathers and gold as its pantli, an identifying marker that is the equivalent
of a modern flag. The pantli was carried by the army general.

The extreme paucity of allusions to umbrellas throughout the Middle Ages shows
that they were not in common use. In an old romance, "The Blonde of Oxford", a
jester makes fun of a nobleman for being out in the rain without his cloak.
"Were I a rich man", says he, "I would bear my house about with me". It appears
that people depended on cloaks, not umbrellas, for protection against storms.

One of the earliest depictions is in a painting by Girolamo dai Libri from 1530
titled Madonna dell Ombrello (Madonna of the Umbrella) in which the Virgin Mary
is sheltered by a cherub carrying a large, red umbrella.

Thomas Wright, in his Domestic Manners of the English, gives a drawing from the
Harleian MS., No. 604, which represents an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out
attended by his servant, the servant carrying an umbrella with a handle that
slopes backwards, so as to bring the umbrella over the head of the person in
front.

The use of the parasol and umbrella in France and England was adopted, probably
from China, about the middle of the seventeenth century.
